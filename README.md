# CNN Image Classification on CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 contains 60,000 images divided into 10 classes, including airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Normalization of image data for better training performance.
- **CNN Architecture:** Three convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and dense layers.
- **Training and Validation:** Accuracy and loss tracking for 10 epochs.
- **Model Evaluation:** Testing the model on unseen data and visualizing predictions.

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). It contains:
- **Training Images:** 50,000 images.
- **Test Images:** 10,000 images.

## Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cnn-image-classification.git
   cd cnn-image-classification
